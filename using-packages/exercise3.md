# Exercise 3: Debugging Missing Packages

## Learning Objectives

- recognize the error message when your program is missing a package
- be able to fix the error by installing the necessary package

## Prerequisites

- you should have Node.js >= v4 installed
- you should have npm v2 or v3 installed

## Instructions

1. Create a directory called `exercise3`
2. Change into that directory using `cd exercise3`
3. Create a file called `index.js`
4. Cut and paste this code into `index.js`:

  ```javascript
  var _ =  require('lodash');
  ```
5. Run your program.
6. Fix the error!

## Hints

- You can run a Node.js program by typing `node <js-file-name` where 
  `js-file-name` is the name of a `.js` file, e.g. `index`, `index.js`
