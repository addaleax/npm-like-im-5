# Up and Running

Understanding how something works is wonderful, but
it is no replacement for practical hands-on experience.
Let's get a Node.js development environment set up on

## Learning Objectives

In this section, we'll learn:

- What Node.js is and how to install it
- What a Node.js version manager is and why we should use one
- How to update npm
